### Introduction

As a previous and current college-goer, it would make sense if I had exposure to college fight songs. However, I can not remember a single word of the fight song of a college that I have gone to. This is why the data (https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/college-fight-song-lyrics/) I'm going to go over is a collection of various parameters regarding the college fight songs of 65 schools which were part of the major sports conferences apparently called the "Power Five".

#### Step 1

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

### Conclusions

The data that was collected by FiveThirtyEight is quite a fun way to collect data. I believe this dataset could be improved by having data collected from more colleges. As of now it only exists for those that actually are within the Power Five sports conferences. However, international and even just more colleges in the United States could definitely spruce the data up.
